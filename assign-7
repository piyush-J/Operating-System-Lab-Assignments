assignment #7



Q1. A barber shop consists of a waiting room with n chairs and a barber room with one barber chair. If there is no customer, the barber goes to sleep. If a customer arrives and finds wait room full(no chair empty),then he leaves else occupy a seat. if the barber is asleep, the customer wakes up the barber and get hair cut.
Sleeping-barber problem  pseudocode -
   semaphore c = 0; // number of customers waiting for hair-cut 
   semaphore binary b = 0; //  barber waiting for customers 
   semaphore binary m = 1; // for mutual exclusion 
  int count = 0; // number of empty chairs

  customer(i)			barber()
 do{                             do {
    wait(m)                          wait(c)
    if (count<N) {                   wait(m) 
       count--                       count++
       signal(c)                     signal(b)
        signal(m)                    signal(m) 
       wait(b)                        #CR do-haircut and leaveshop
       #CR get-haircut               } while(TRUE)
       }                             
     else  {
       signal(m)
      //leaveshop
       }
   }while (TRUE)

validate for six customers and N=3,if context switch after each statement
(assume  during get-haircut() or do-haircut() other process runs three statements - these functions takes 3 context switch)

Q2. Automated traffic light system, based on Number of vehicles in any of direction-
north-south(ToFromMalaviyanagar) and east-west(ToFromBhaskar), controlled by controller
connected to respective sensor(camera)in that direction.
Pseducode based on monitor is given-

monitor traficJunction{
  int ToFromMalaviyanagar =0, ToFromBhaskar=0;
signal ToFromMalaviyanagarLight=RED, ToFromBhaskarLight=RED;
condition busy;

public:
  MalaviyanagarTraffic()  // vehicles to or from malaviya nagar
  {
   if(ToFromBhaskar>0) wait(busy) ; // traffic light GREEN for to or from bhaskar
   ToFromMalaviyanagarLight = GREEN;
   ToFromBhaskarLight = RED;
   ToFromMalaviyanagar += 1;//start
  }
  BhaskarTraffic()  // vehicles to or from Bhaskar
   {
   if(ToFromMalaviyanagar>0) wait(busy) ; // traffic light GREEN for to or from malaviya nagar
      ToFromBhaskarLight = GREEN;
   ToFromMalaviyanagarLight = RED;
   ToFromBhaskar += 1;  //start
  }
 Junctionfree(Flow empty)   //No vehicle at junction
 {
  if(empty == Malaviyanagar) 
    { ToFromMalaviyanagar -= 1;
      if(ToFromMalaviyanagar == 0) signal(busy);
    }
  else if(empty==Bhaskar)
     {  ToFromBhaskar -= 1;
        if(ToFromBhaskar == 0) signal(busy); 
     }
 }
} // end of monitor
//(controller(NS))		//(controller(EW))
P0()              	 	 P1()
while(TRUE)			while(TRUE()
{				{
MalaviyanagarTraffic()		  BhaskarTraffic()
# TRAFFIC FLOW			  # TRAFFIC FLOW
Junctionfree(Malaviyanagar) 	  Junctionfree(Bhaskar) 
}				}

Explain the working of above code for-
(a) North-South traffic light GREEN, three vehicles to cross junction
    camera(P1) senses a vehicle in East-West direction		
(b) Currently no vehicle at junction,cameras (P1,P0) sense a vehicle in 
their respective direction(in given order).
