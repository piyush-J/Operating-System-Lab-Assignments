assignment #6

 Write pseudo algorithm for process synchronization problems-
  (Show  complete execution steps for all processes)
Q1. Show how producer-consumer problem gives inconsistancy when shared variable is modified by both the processes.
(i) Context switching process after execution of each statement
(ii) ontext switching such that it results in inconsistancy of shared variable

Q2. Validate following pseudocode for three processes for correctness of ME using swap instruction
    where lock is shared boolean variable , initial value of lock is FALSE
    and key is local boolean variable
        P(i)
   do { 
       key=TRUE;
       while (key == TRUE)swap(&lock,&key);
       // CR
       lock = FALSE;
       ...
      } while(TRUE)
   
Q3. Validate following pseudocode  for four(n=4) processes for correctness of ME using TSL instruction
    verify that bounded wait for waiting processes
    shared boolean lock = FALSE    
    shared boolean wait[i]=FALSE , i=0 to 3
    key is local boolean variable
        P(i)
    do {
       wait[i]=TRUE;
       key=TRUE;
       while (key && wait[i]) key=TSL(&lock);
       wait[i]=FALSE;
       // CR
       j =(i + 1) % n;  // mod operation
       while ( (j != i) && ! wait[j] ) j =(j+ i)% n;
       if (j==i)  lock = FALSE;//if no process waiting then reset
       else  wait[j] = FALSE;//allow next waiting process
       ...
      } while(TRUE)
   
Q4. Write complete pseudocode for producer-consumer problem with infinite buffer using counting semaphores
    binary semaphore mutex=TRUE
    counting semaphore n=0
    validate no violation of ME

Q5. Write complete pseudocode for producer-consumer problem with finite buffer(size 10) using counting semaphores
    binary semaphore mutex=TRUE
    counting semaphore Full=0,Empty=10
    assume one producer process and three consumer processes
   (i) each processe executes three (or less if blocked) statements before context switch to other process (perform for 24 context switching)
   (ii) same as (i) but Full=5, Empty=5 (perform for 24 context switching)

Q6. Write complete pseudocode for reader-writer problem with (context switch after every statement)
    (i) Reader priority     (ii) no priority(fair policy)   (iii) Writer priority
    (Write CR takes 8 context switching and Reader CR takes 8 context switching)
    The order of arrival of processes for case
    (i) R1  R2  W1 ..... R3  R4  W2 W3 ... R5 R6
    (dots shows number of context switching that is delay between arrival of next processes
    (ii) R1  R2  W1 ..(a)... R3  R4  W2 W3 ..(b). R5 R6
    (iii) R1 ... R2  W1  R3  R4 . W2 W3 .. R5 R6
  
    Show  complete execution order for all processes
    Give final order of process completion
